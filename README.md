# ExamForge

ExamForge is a web-based question bank and quiz player with email/password login, timed or untimed practice, and an allowlist for paid users.

## What you can do
- Sign up or sign in with your email and choose a bank to practice.
- Pick timed or untimed mode before starting; see per-question explanations only after you submit.
- Navigate questions with the left sidebar, submit answers, finish to see your score, and track basic stats.
- If your email isn’t on the allowlist, you’ll see a clear “Please contact Zaid to enable access” gate.

## Getting access (paid allowlist)
- Allowed emails exist on a whitelist. Zaid adds or removes emails there to grant/revoke access.
- If you’re blocked, contact Zaid with the email you use to sign in so he can allow it.

## Feedback and support
- Contact Zaid via whatsapp or instagram (@al_jumailyz)
